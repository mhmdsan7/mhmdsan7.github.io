— The never-ending cycle of ransomware evolution

## 🧨 Who is RansomHub?

**RansomHub** is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group that emerged in early 2024 and quickly gained attention in the cyber threat landscape. Believed to be a rebrand or evolution of the **Knight** or **ALPHV (BlackCat)** ransomware gangs, RansomHub has built a solid affiliate model, targeting large enterprises through double extortion tactics.

Their leak site is hosted on the dark web and lists a growing number of victims — often with partial data dumps to pressure companies into payment.

## ⚙️ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

RansomHub follows a typical but effective RaaS model. Here’s how they operate:

- **Initial Access**: Often gained via compromised credentials, phishing emails, or leaked VPN access.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Use of known Windows exploits and living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).
- **Payload Delivery**: Encrypted Golang-based ransomware binary with anti-analysis features.
- **Exfiltration**: Data is stolen before encryption for double extortion.
- **Ransom Note**: Unique ID and instructions to communicate via a TOR-hosted portal.

---

## 🧠 Technical Observations

- Written in **Golang**, which helps evade traditional signature-based detection.
- Uses multiple **obfuscation layers** and **mutex locking** to avoid repeated infections.
- Known to deploy **Cobalt Strike**, **Mimikatz**, and **rclone** during lateral movement and exfiltration.

---

## 🌍 Victim Profile

RansomHub does not appear to discriminate heavily by industry. Victims so far include:

- R&D-heavy firms
- Healthcare providers
- Manufacturing and mining companies (e.g., suspected targeting of firms like Ryerson)
- Educational institutions

This group often targets organizations with **weak EDR**, **unpatched VPNs**, or **outdated on-prem systems**.

|-----------|------------------------------|
| IP        | `185.244.30[.]50`            |
| Domain    | `ransomhub[.]onion`          |
| File hash | `ec5b7e...` (SHA256, redacted)|
| C2 URL    | `hxxp://ransom-node[.]org`   |

## 🔒 Defensive Recommendations

1. **Harden VPNs**: Use MFA and monitor for brute-force attempts.
2. **Patch RDP & Fortinet appliances** regularly.
3. **Implement network segmentation** to isolate backups and critical data.
4. **Monitor for Golang executables**, especially in temp/user folders.
5. **Threat hunt** for tools like rclone, Mimikatz, or unexpected Cobalt Strike beacons.

## 🔚 Conclusion

RansomHub is another sign that **ransomware isn’t going away**, it’s just rebranding, refining, and recruiting. Organizations must treat **threat intelligence as continuous** — not reactive.

> Stay paranoid, patch regularly, and always know who’s after your data.
